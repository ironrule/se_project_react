**Intro**

This project is designed to retrieve data via an online Weather API and return this information through text and graphics to the user. Based upon this weather data, clothing suggestions will be made for what may be appropriate to wear in the current weather.

The first phase of the project is creating the main site and adding popup functionality for adding additional garments and viewing the existing garments. The basic layout of the site will be completed by the end of this phase. The Weather API will also be functional.

The second phase includes adding the functionality for each of the popups, and the ability to add and delete clothing items.

The third phase of this project is connecting it to the back-end which is linked in the Hosted Site section below.

**Development and Technologies**

This project is being developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. Vite is being used to create the project basis, and React modules are being added to the main site entrypoint. The site incorporates custom fonts to match the design specification.

**Hosted Site**

The site is currently hosted on GitHub Pages at the following address:

Note: Not all functionality has been deployed to GitHub Pages due to JSON server implementation. This will be updated in a future phase.
